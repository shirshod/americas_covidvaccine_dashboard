### Notes:

Lacking a reliable, cohesive and unified database for demographic profiles and economic indicators of all the countries in the Americas, the team from the Miami Herald, el Nuevo Herald and McClatchy Washington Bureau used estimates and projections from a variety of sources to build their own database. 

Data for population, percentage of people living below the poverty line and percentage of people with healthcare coverage were sourced from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). In cases where the numbers for people living below the poverty line were not recorded by ECLAC, the team used data from the World Bank. 

The team used estimates from the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook Database for per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the ratio of public debt to GDP. Where figures were not available from the UN, the IMF or the World Bank, the team relied on latest statistics published by the Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook. 
The team used ECLAC data to estimate Cuba’s per capita GDP, which is not recorded by the IMF. 

The U.S. Census Bureau was the source for data on the U.S. population, the percentage of people living in poverty and Puerto Rico’s population. For Puerto Rico’s GDP per capita, the team used World Bank data. The team relied on Statistics Canada to determine Canada’s population and percentage of Canadians living below the poverty line. The average per capita GDP in Latin America and the Caribbean ⁠— $8,870 ⁠— was determined by the World Bank and the average percentage of population living in poverty, 30.5 percent, was provided by ECLAC. 

The number for COVID cases and COVID-related deaths were taken from the World Health Organization/Pan American Health Organization. For data on vaccinations, the team used statistics compiled by Oxford University.

The automated dashboard is based on data from the 37 countries and dependencies in the Americas that are uniformly reporting numbers for vaccinations, COVID cases and deaths periodically, if not daily.
